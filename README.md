- 👋 Hi, I’m @heatherusa
- 👀 I’m interested in working on my first coding projects.  To date, I have only worked on school assignments and would like to start working on some other projects outside of the classroom.  
- 🌱 I’m currently working on earning my BSCS with a major in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University.  I have already taken C++, Python, Java, and SQL. I want to keep what I've learned active so that I do not lose any newly acquired skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller projects to start. Something with any of the previously mentioned languages.  
- 📫 I can be reached at wood_817@hotmail.com
