- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Heather!!  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve just graduated from SNHU with my BSCS majoring in Software engineering.  I have already taken C++, Python, Java, and SQL. I want to keep what I've learned active so that I do not lose any newly acquired skills.
- ðŸ‘€ Currently studying for my Azure DP-900 Certification, hoping to land my first role as a data engineer.
- ðŸ›« I would love to meet new people and make some fun connections so please reach out, I'd love to connect!
